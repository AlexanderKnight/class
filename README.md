## Course Summary

Topics include: Elementary Numerical
Methods, Algorithm Development and Optimization, Parallel Programming
Techniques, Distributed Processing over Multiple CPUs, Code Management
and Interfacing to Fortran/C Programming Libraries, Data
Visualization, Source Control.

## Course Description

This course gives an introduction into various areas of
high-performance computing, providing a basis for writing and working
with high-performance simulation codes.

The three main focus areas are "barely sufficient software
engineering", basics of high-performance and parallel programming, and
visualization. Special topics may include a modern HPC language like
[Julia](http://julialang.org), specific hardware architectures,
automatic code generation and performance tuning.

The section on software engineering will introduce basic tools and
methods for writing and maintaining portable code, selecting the right
language for a task at hand, and exploiting existing tools.

In the section on high-performance computing, we will review the
history of HPC, future directions and how it is now necessary to use
parallelism at multiple levels. Basic parallel programming models will
be introduced, with a focus on learning how to use MPI.

The last section will provide an overview of some of the visualization
packages available, with a focus on getting to know python/pylab and
visit.

## Prerequisites

Enrollment in a CEPS graduate program, MATH 753,
working knowledge of a programming language (C or Fortran), or by
permission of instructor.

## Reading

There is no required textbook for this class. Occasional readings assignments
will be posted and particpants are expected to finish those before
class time.

Some recommended books:

 * Writing Scientific Software -- A guide to good style, by Suely
   Oliveira \& David Stewart, Cambridge, 2006

 * Parallel Programming, by Barry Wilkinson and Michael Allen, Pearson
   Prentice Hall, 2005

 * Parallel Programming in C with MPI and OpenMP, by Michael J. Quinn,
   Michelle L. Flomenhoft, Elizabeth, A. Jones, McGraw-Hill, 2003

## Grading Policy

Regular homework and reading [assignments](assignments.md) will be given and
are expected to be completed by their due date. Late submissions may
receive partial credit, but no credit is given after sample solutions
are posted. Participation in class discussions and in-class exercises
is required. Homework will be posted on the respective class web
pages; it is your responsibility to check for new assignments.

In addition there will be two projects: one midterm project and one
final project. Some projects may be divided into a number of
subprojects which are expected to be finished by their individual due
date, before the due date of the complete project. Some of the
assignments will be designated as team efforts.

Every student is expected to give one presentation to the rest of the
class during the course of the semester. You will research one
specific topic (from the area of HPC) and introduce it to the rest of
the class. Ideally, you will pick your topic yourself according to
your interests, in coordination with the instructor.

The final grade will be calculated as follows: Homework assignments
and class participation 30%, presentation 10%, midterm project: 30%, final project: 30%

## Student Accessibility Services

According to the Americans with Disabilities Act (as amended, 2008),
each student with a disability has the right to request services from
UNH to accommodate his/her disability. If you are a student with a
documented disability or believe you may have a disability that
requires accommodations, please contact Student Accessibility Services
(SAS) at 201 Smith Hall. Accommodation letters are created by SAS with
the student. Please follow-up with your instructor as soon as possible
to ensure timely implementation of the identified accommodations in
the letter. Faculty have an obligation to respond once they receive
official notice of accommodations from SAS, but are under no
obligation to provide retroactive accommodations.  For more
information refer to www.unh.edu/studentaccessibility or contact SAS
at 603.862.2607, 711 (Relay NH) or sas.office@unh.edu.

## Emotional or Mental Health Distress

Your academic success in this course is very important to me. If,
during the semester, you find emotional or mental health issues are
affecting that success, please contact the Universityâ€™s Counseling
Center (3rd floor, Smith Hall; 603 862-2090/TTY: 7-1-1) which provides
counseling appointments and other mental health services.
