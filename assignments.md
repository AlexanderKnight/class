## Homework assignments

### Assignment 1 (due 1/29/19) 

 * Make sure that you can log in to fishercat from your laptop (if you
   have a Windows laptop, I can help with setting up VNC / ssh
   tunneling).
 * Finish your student page on the wiki.
   

### Assignment 2 (due 1/31/19)

 * Read this [paper](BarelySufficientSoftwareEngineering.pdf), and
   make note of a point you found interesting.

 * Make sure that you're all set with respect to having an editor to
   write code, and a compiler that works.
   
### Assignment 3 (due 2/5/19)

 * (yes, for those who to pay attention, I realized it's 2019 now...)
 
 * Finish moving the `factorial()` function out into a separate file,
   and adjust build and header files as needed. Take into account what
   you (hopefully) learned from the next question, too. You don't
   actually have to submit this yet to github, since I haven't really
   told you how to.
   
  * Do this
    [your turn](https://github.com/unh-hpc-2019/class/wiki/Class-4#your-turn) question.
    Email me your answer, including, ideally, how to prevent this
    problem from happening, or at least have the compiler make you
    aware of it.
	
### (Assignment 4) (due 2/7/19)

 * Submit your homework from Assignment 3 (the factorial part) via a
   github pull request.
   
   Quick summary:
   
   * clone your class-3-your-team
   * make a new branch
   * do the work
   * commit the work
   * push (publish) the branch to github
   * open a pull request on github
   
### Assignment 5 (due 2/12/19)
   
  * Finish the in-class exercises ("Your turn" sections) from https://github.com/unh-hpc-2019/class/wiki/Class-6. Start from the github classroom assignment (class-5-your-team), make the changes and commit as you, and push back to github, open a pull request. If you've already done the work in the class 3 repo, you can instead point me there.
 
    Read the part about header file dependencies, and correspondingly change your Makefile in your assignment. What happens if you edit `hello.h` and then `make` again. Is that expected? Why? (Put the answer to these questions as comments into your pull request)
     
  * Look at the [Topics](https://github.com/unh-hpc-2019/class/wiki/Topics) for this class and vote up or down topics you find particularly interesting or not-so-interesting. To do so, just edit the wiki page and add "+" or "-" to topics of your choice.
 
### Assignment 7 (due 2/14/19)

* Finish the in-class exercises from https://github.com/unh-hpc-2019/class/wiki/Class-7. You can either start from the class-7 github classroom assignment, or from one of the previous assignments -- in the latter case, make sure you use a different branch name from previous homework. Create a PR (pull request), and request me as reviewer. Nothing needs to be done about the cmake part in the end.

### Assignment 8 (due 2/19/19)

* Finish the in-class exercises from https://github.com/unh-hpc-2019/class/wiki/Class-8, based on the github classroom assignment. Create a PR (pull request), and request me as reviewer. Please put the answers to the questions in the various "in-class exercises" into the PR as comments (copy&pasting, e.g, compiler output might be helpful).

### Assignment 9 (due 2/21/19)

* As usual, finish the in-class exercises from https://github.com/unh-hpc-2019/class/wiki/Class-9.

### Assignment 10 (due 2/26/19)

* As usual, finish the in-class exercises from https://github.com/unh-hpc-2019/class/wiki/Class-10, and the Homework part I added at the bottom.

### Assignment 12 (due 3/5/19)

* Do the in-class exercises from https://github.com/unh-hpc-2019/class/wiki/Class-12.
* If you have not yet done so, sign up for a presentation on the Presentations wiki page.
